Disclaimer:
 License phrase written in the released file 'LICENSE' is "Free for any
 use with your own risk!" or Public Domain License but the copyright holder
 emailed Taku that the software has been licensed under the same license as Ruby.
 The upstream sources claims in the file 'metadata.yml' that the license
 is Public Domain License. So, for the moment, we switch to this later one.
